# Guidelines for Equity-First Annotation Practices

## 📌 Purpose
Annotation is not a neutral act. Every label, tag, or prompt contributes to the **ethical DNA of AI systems**. This document provides **guidelines for equity-first annotation**, ensuring that data practices foster *growth with equity* rather than deepen divides.

## 🌱 Core Principles of Inclusive Annotation

### 1) Respect for Human Dignity
- Avoid stereotypes or biased categories.  
- Use respectful, community-preferred terminology.  
- Reflect diverse identities, languages, and cultures.

### 2) Contextual Awareness
- Don’t decontextualize sensitive content (caste, race, gender, class).  
- When ambiguous, **document the context** rather than forcing a label.  
- Flag culturally specific or contested categories.

### 3) Equity in Representation
- Balance datasets to include **marginalized voices**.  
- Counter historical exclusions with targeted inclusion.  
- Avoid over-representing dominant narratives.

### 4) Transparency and Accountability
- Record **annotation choices, rationales, and revisions**.  
- Encourage annotators to **self-document observed biases**.  
- Publish guidelines publicly where possible.

### 5) Well-Being of Annotators
- Acknowledge emotional/cognitive load.  
- Provide breaks, safeguards, and fair pay.  
- Treat annotators as **ethical agents**, not invisible labor.

## 🧭 Philosophical Note
Annotation is authorship. Each decision shapes how intelligence is trained, deployed, and remembered. Equity-first annotation ensures **technology serves justice, not prejudice**.
