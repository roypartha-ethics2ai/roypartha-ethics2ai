# 🧱 Ethical Frameworks for Inclusive AI

## Purpose

This folder contains reproducible ethical models, annotation guidelines, and civic scaffolds for building AI systems that honor **growth with equity**. These frameworks are designed to support researchers, annotators, and technologists in embedding editorial clarity, philosophical discipline, and civic responsibility into every stage of AI development.

## Core Principles

1. **Growth with Equity**  
   AI must uplift all communities—not deepen existing divides. Annotation, training, and deployment must reflect inclusive intent.

2. **Editorial Stewardship**  
   Every label, prompt, and dataset is a form of authorship. Precision in language is a civic act.

3. **Karmic Accountability**  
   Developers and annotators are not neutral—they are ethical agents. Transparency in licensing, authorship, and intent is essential.

4. **Civic Anchoring**  
   AI must serve public dignity, not private dominance. Frameworks must be reproducible, accessible, and open to scrutiny.

## Philosophical Note

These frameworks are not static—they are living documents. They evolve with civic feedback, spiritual reflection, and editorial iteration. They are offered in the spirit of **karmic authorship**, where every ethical scaffold is a thread in the fabric of technological justice.
